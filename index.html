		<h2>The Rose-Tree</h2>
		<p>
			There was once upon a time a good man who had two children: a
			girl by a first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was 
			as white as milk, and her lips were like cherries. Her hair 
			was like golden silk, and it hung to the ground. Her brother 
			loved her dearly, but her wicked stepmother hated her. 
			<q>Child,</q> said the stepmother one day, <q>go to the 
			grocer's shop and buy me a pound of candles.</q> She gave her 
			the money; and the little girl went, bought the candles, and 
			started on her return. There was a stile to cross. She put 
			down the candles whilst she got over the stile. Up came a dog 
			and ran off with the candles.
		</p>
		<p>
			She went back to the grocer's, and she got a second bunch. 
			She came to the stile, set down the candles, and proceeded to 
			climb over. Up came the dog and ran off with the candles.
		</p>
		<p>
			She went again to the grocer's, and she got a third bunch; 
			and just the same happened. Then she came to her stepmother 
			crying, for she had spent all the money and had lost three 
			bunches of candles.
